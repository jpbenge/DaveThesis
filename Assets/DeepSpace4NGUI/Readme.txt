DeepSpace for NGUI is a skin that requires NGUI v.2.6.2 or above to work. It contains a scene (DeepSpaceNGUI_TestScene) with NGUI scripts, which allow you to see all the elements on a simple working example. 
There are two fonts used in the skin, both are free for both commercial and private use - see .txt files for each font.

If you experience any problems with the asset when using with the latest NGUI v.3 - please import DS_NGUI_302.unitypackage instead. This package requires Unity 4.2 to work.
